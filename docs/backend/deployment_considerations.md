### Serverless Functions

The API routes will be deployed as serverless functions on Vercel:

- Each API route becomes a serverless function
- Cold starts may impact performance for infrequently used endpoints
- Function timeout limits (10-60 seconds) must be considered for long-running operations

### Environment Variables

Required environment variables for deployment:

```
# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:port/database

# NextAuth.js
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://your-app-url.com
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-secret-key

# File Storage
BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN=your-vercel-blob-token
# or
S3_ACCESS_KEY=your-s3-access-key
S3_SECRET_KEY=your-s3-secret-key

S3_REGION=your-s3-region

# Optional: Email (for password reset)
EMAIL_SERVER=smtp://username:password@smtp.example.com:587
EMAIL_FROM=noreply@example.com
```

## Deployment Strategy

### Phased Deployment Approach

To minimize risk and ensure a smooth transition, we recommend a phased deployment approach:

#### Phase 1: Fix Current Deployment Issue

1. Replace react-swipeable-views with Swiper in inventory/add/page.js
2. Deploy the fix to restore the current localStorage-based application
3. Verify the application is functioning correctly

#### Phase 2: Database and Authentication Setup

1. Set up the PostgreSQL database
2. Deploy the database schema using Prisma migrations
3. Implement and deploy the authentication system
4. Create a separate deployment branch/preview for testing

#### Phase 3: API Implementation and Testing

1. Implement API routes in batches (customers, inventory, sales, etc.)
2. Deploy each batch to the testing environment
3. Perform thorough testing of each API endpoint
4. Update frontend hooks to use API endpoints in the testing environment

#### Phase 4: Data Migration

1. Develop and test the data migration utility
2. Create a staging environment with production data
3. Perform a trial migration in the staging environment
4. Validate data integrity and application functionality

#### Phase 5: Production Deployment

1. Schedule a maintenance window for the production deployment
2. Perform the data migration from localStorage to the database
3. Deploy the full backend implementation to production
4. Monitor the application closely for any issues

### Rollback Plan

In case of critical issues during deployment:

1. Maintain the ability to switch back to localStorage persistence
2. Keep database backups before and after migration
3. Document specific rollback procedures for each deployment phase
4. Test rollback procedures in the staging environment
