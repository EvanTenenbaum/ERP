# Mobile-First Design Implementation for Hemp ERP

## Overview

This document details the mobile-first design implementation for the Hemp ERP system, with a specific focus on optimizing the user interface for one-handed operation, particularly for inventory intake processes.

## Design Principles

The implementation follows these key mobile-first design principles:

1. **One-Handed Operation**: All critical functions are accessible within thumb reach
2. **Progressive Disclosure**: Complex forms are broken into manageable steps
3. **Large Touch Targets**: Interactive elements are sized for easy tapping (minimum 48px)
4. **Bottom-Aligned Controls**: Primary actions are positioned at the bottom of the screen
5. **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Only essential information is displayed at once
6. **Swipe Navigation**: Intuitive gesture-based navigation between form steps
7. **Responsive Adaptation**: Seamless experience across mobile and desktop devices

## Key Components

### 1. Responsive Layout System

- **MobileLayout**: Bottom navigation, speed dial for quick actions, and drawer menu
- **ResponsiveLayout**: Intelligent switching between mobile and desktop layouts
- **Custom Theme**: Mobile-optimized typography, spacing, and component styles

### 2. Step-by-Step Inventory Intake

The inventory intake process has been completely redesigned with a step-by-step approach:
