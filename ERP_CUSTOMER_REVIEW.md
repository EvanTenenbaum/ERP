# ERP System Customer Review

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive review of the Multi-Tenant ERP System from a customer perspective. It identifies current issues, suggests improvements, and highlights low-hanging fruit opportunities for enhancing functionality and stability.

## Navigation and User Experience

### Current Issues

1. **Navigation Links Not Working**: 
   - While the URL encoding issue has been fixed (no more %7Bdashboard%7D in URLs), all links result in 404 errors
   - Links correctly navigate to URLs like "http://localhost:3000/inventory" but these pages aren't being found
   - Root cause: The routing configuration needs to be updated to properly map these URLs to the actual pages in the {dashboard} route group

2. **Inconsistent Dashboard Link**:
   - The "Go to Dashboard" link points to "/" which is actually the home page, not a dashboard
   - This creates confusion about what the dashboard actually is

3. **Missing Navigation Menu**:
   - No persistent navigation menu across pages
   - Users have to return to the home page to navigate between sections
   - No breadcrumbs to show current location within the application

### Suggested Improvements

1. **Fix Routing Configuration**:
   - Implement proper routing to map URLs like "/inventory" to the corresponding pages in the {dashboard} route group
   - Consider using Next.js rewrites in next.config.js to handle this mapping

2. **Add Persistent Navigation**:
   - Implement a sidebar or top navigation bar that appears on all pages
   - Include links to all main sections (Inventory, Customers, Sales, Reports, Vendors)
   - Highlight the current section to show users where they are

3. **Implement Breadcrumbs**:
   - Add breadcrumb navigation to show the current location within the application
   - Example: Home > Inventory > Add Item

4. **Improve Dashboard Link**:
   - Create an actual dashboard page with key metrics and quick links
   - Rename the home page link to "Home" for clarity

## Conclusion

The Multi-Tenant ERP System has a solid foundation with a well-structured codebase and comprehensive feature plans. However, there are significant gaps between the planned features and the current implementation. The most critical issues are the non-functional navigation links and missing core functionality.

By addressing the low-hanging fruit opportunities first, the system could quickly become usable while more complex features are developed incrementally. The routing configuration issue should be the top priority as it prevents users from accessing any part of the application beyond the home page.

With these improvements, the ERP system could become a valuable tool for hemp flower wholesale brokerage businesses, providing the comprehensive solution described in the project overview.
