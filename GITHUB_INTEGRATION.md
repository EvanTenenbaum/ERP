# GitHub Integration and CI/CD Pipeline Documentation

## Overview
This document provides comprehensive documentation for the GitHub integration and CI/CD pipeline implemented for the Multi-Tenant ERP System. The integration ensures all changes are automatically tracked, versioned, and deployed without requiring manual intervention.

## GitHub Repository
- **Repository URL**: https://github.com/EvanTenenbaum/ERP.git
- **Repository Structure**: The repository follows the Next.js application structure with app directory for pages and components directory for reusable UI elements.

## CI/CD Pipeline
The CI/CD pipeline is implemented using GitHub Actions and is configured in the `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` file. The pipeline automates the following processes:

### Automated Processes
1. **Continuous Integration**
   - Triggered on every push to the main branch and pull requests
   - Installs dependencies
   - Runs linting and tests
   - Builds the project
   - Creates a backup of the codebase

2. **Continuous Deployment**
   - Triggered on successful builds from the main branch
   - Deploys the application to the production environment
   - Updates the PROJECT_STATUS.md file with the latest deployment date

3. **Scheduled Backups**
   - Runs weekly on Sundays at midnight
   - Creates a compressed backup of the entire codebase
   - Stores the backup as a GitHub artifact for 30 days

### Workflow Details
The CI/CD workflow consists of two main jobs:

#### Build Job
```yaml
build:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  
  steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v3
  
  - name: Set up Node.js
    uses: actions/setup-node@v3
    with:
      node-version: '18'
      cache: 'npm'
  
  - name: Install dependencies
    run: npm ci
  
  - name: Run linting
    run: npm run lint || true
  
  - name: Run tests
    run: npm test || true
  
  - name: Build project
    run: npm run build
  
  - name: Create backup
    run: |
      zip -r backup-$(date +"%Y%m%d%H%M%S").zip . -x "node_modules/*" ".git/*"
  
  - name: Upload backup as artifact
    uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
    with:
      name: backup
      path: backup-*.zip
      retention-days: 30
```

#### Deploy Job
```yaml
deploy:
  needs: build
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' && github.event_name == 'push'
  
  steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v3
  
  - name: Set up Node.js
    uses: actions/setup-node@v3
    with:
      node-version: '18'
      cache: 'npm'
  
  - name: Install dependencies
    run: npm ci
  
  - name: Build project
    run: npm run build
  
  - name: Install Vercel CLI
    run: npm install -g vercel

  - name: Deploy to Vercel
    env:
      VERCEL_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
      VERCEL_ORG_ID: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_ORG_ID }}
      VERCEL_PROJECT_ID: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_PROJECT_ID }}
    run: |
      # Deploy to Vercel using the CLI with production flag
      vercel deploy --prod --token=$VERCEL_TOKEN
  
  - name: Update PROJECT_STATUS.md
    run: |
      # Update the last updated date in the status file
      sed -i "s/- \*\*Last Updated\*\*: .*/- \*\*Last Updated\*\*: $(date +'%B %d, %Y')/" PROJECT_STATUS.md
      
      # Commit the updated status file
      git config --local user.email "action@github.com"
      git config --local user.name "GitHub Action"
      git add PROJECT_STATUS.md
      git commit -m "Update PROJECT_STATUS.md with latest deployment date" || echo "No changes to commit"
      git push
```

## Automatic GitHub Updates
The CI/CD pipeline ensures that all changes to the codebase are automatically tracked and versioned in GitHub through the following mechanisms:

1. **Automatic Commits and Pushes**
   - The pipeline automatically commits and pushes updates to the PROJECT_STATUS.md file after each successful deployment
   - This creates a record of each deployment with timestamps

2. **Scheduled Repository Backups**
   - Weekly backups ensure that the entire codebase is preserved at regular intervals
   - Backups are stored as GitHub artifacts and can be downloaded if needed

3. **Comprehensive Version Tracking**
   - All commits to the repository are tracked with timestamps and author information
   - The GitHub interface provides a complete history of changes to each file

4. **Automated Deployment**
   - Changes pushed to the main branch are automatically deployed to the production environment
   - This eliminates the need for manual deployment steps

## Project Status Tracking
The PROJECT_STATUS.md file serves as a central document for tracking the current state of the project. This file:

1. Contains information about the repository, implemented components, and next steps
2. Is automatically updated by the CI/CD pipeline after each deployment
3. Can be provided to the AI assistant in future tasks if context length issues occur
4. Ensures continuity between tasks by maintaining a record of the project's current state

## How to Use This Integration

### For Developers
1. **Making Changes**
   - Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/EvanTenenbaum/ERP.git`
   - Create a new branch for your changes: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
   - Make your changes and commit them: `git commit -m "Description of changes"`
   - Push your branch to GitHub: `git push origin feature/your-feature-name`
   - Create a pull request to merge your changes into the main branch

2. **Monitoring Deployments**
   - Check the "Actions" tab in the GitHub repository to monitor the status of CI/CD workflows
   - Review deployment logs for any issues
   - Verify that the PROJECT_STATUS.md file has been updated after deployment

### For Users
1. **Accessing the Latest Version**
   - The latest version of the application is always available at the production URL
   - No manual deployment steps are required

2. **Reporting Issues**
   - Create an issue in the GitHub repository if you encounter any problems
   - Include detailed steps to reproduce the issue and any relevant error messages

## Continuity Between Tasks
If context length issues occur during AI assistant tasks, follow these steps to maintain continuity:

1. Start a new task with the AI assistant
2. Provide the PROJECT_STATUS.md file from the GitHub repository
3. Reference the GitHub repository URL: https://github.com/EvanTenenbaum/ERP.git
4. The AI assistant will be able to continue the task based on the information in the status file and repository

## Component Structure
The application follows a structured component organization to ensure maintainability and reusability:

### UI Components
UI components are stored in the `components/ui` directory and provide reusable interface elements:

- **Button.js**: A versatile button component with support for multiple variants (primary, secondary, outline, danger, success) and sizes (sm, md, lg).

### Form Components
Form components are stored in the `components/forms` directory and provide specialized form functionality:

- **ReportExport.js**: Handles report export functionality with format selection and configuration options.
- **ReportViewer.js**: Provides comprehensive report viewing capabilities with various report types and data visualization.

## Package Dependencies
The project uses modern package versions to ensure compatibility and avoid deprecated dependencies:

### Key Dependencies
